##### *In review with Geoderma* 

Research Objective: Measure the impact of repeated freeze-thaw cycles on the physical structure of permafrost aggregates using non-destructive, high resolution imaging capabilities (XCT) at resolutions of 20 Âµm. 

Approach: We measured how soil pore networks in macroaggregates (2.5 cm3) subsampled from permafrost soils (Toolik, AK) responded to five experimental freeze-thaw cycles (-10C to 20C) that simulated conditions relevant to Arctic surface environments. We investigated pore morphology and deformation due to freeze-thaw by measuring pore connectivity and pore throat diameter distribution before and after freeze-thaw events. 

Hypotheses: We hypothesized that freeze-thaw would increase pore connectivity across all aggregates through the expansion of smaller pore throats (<50 microns), based on findings from prior work (Deprez et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021b; Ma et al., 2021; Starkloff et al., 2017). 

We provide a pore-scale perspective on changes to the pore network occurring at this incipient stage of permafrost warming, specifically within the first five freeze-thaw cycles following thaw. Our work contributes to the current understanding of freeze-thaw deformation while providing data needed for future predictions of how climate warming will alter the physical properties of globally important Arctic landscapes.
